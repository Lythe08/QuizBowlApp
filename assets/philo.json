This attitude titles a Saul Kripke paper which imagines Pierre who accepts both \"London is not pretty\" and \"Londres est jolie.\" The oddity of asserting P while denying you have this attitude toward P is known as Moore's paradox. The branch of modal logic modeling this attitude is called (*) doxastic logic. Bayesian epistemology treats these attitudes as coming in degrees which are representable as subjective probabilities. Edmund Gettier's namesake \"cases\" show that a justified true attitude of this kind may fail to constitute knowledge. For 10 points, identify these attitudes we have about what is true."
